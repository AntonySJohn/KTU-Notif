It is also observed that insufficient number of senior faculty affected the teaching -\nlearning processes in the colleges.\nAfter considering the matter in detail, it is ordered that the institutions are not allowed to collect tuition fee from\n'FE\" grade students unless they strictly follow the mandatory AICTE faculty student ratio (1: 20) and the cadre\nratio (1:2:6) in their institutions.<!-- </a> -->\n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        \t\t\t\t\n                            \t\t\t\t<p>\n                            \t\t\t \t\t\n                            \t\t \t\t\n                            \t\t \t\n                            \t\t \t\t\n                            \t\t \t\t</p>\n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        \t\t\t</li>"
